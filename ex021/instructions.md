Changing a verb in English to a corresponding adverb is fairly straight forward in English.

There are three rules to follow:
- In most cases, we do this by simply adding -ly to the end of the adjective
- When the adjective you want to make into an adverb ends in -y, you must change the y to an i, then add -ly.
- When the adjective ends in -le, remove the e and replace it with a y.

Create a method makeAdjective which does exactly this.
