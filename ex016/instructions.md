#### DonutBoxes

Create a method that calculates how many boxes a bakery will require for an order of donuts. Each box can contain up to 12 donuts. Each order will require a minimum one box, and obviously the bakery wants to use the minimum amount of boxes.

Hint: this can be done using basic mathematical operators. No need for conditional statements!
