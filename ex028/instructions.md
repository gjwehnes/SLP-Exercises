Write a method investmentCalculator that checks how many years it would take for an initial investment to reach a target investment, given compound growth at an annual interest rate.
 
**Note**: The core of this calculation is simple, and can be written with a while loop. However, there are two unusual cases which would give you an infinite loop, because the initial investment would never reach the target investment. Mathematically, you would say that the answer is undefined. You will need to handle these separately. Coders have traditionally used a return value of -1 to indicate that the answer is undefined,

See the unit tests for example output.
