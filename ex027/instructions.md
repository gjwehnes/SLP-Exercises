### Loops5

Write a method getTimesDivisible that checks how many times the divisor can be iteratively divided (using integer division) into a given dividend.

#### Input
- Neither dividend nor divisor can be negative (to keep this problem simple); if either one is, throw an IllegalArgumentException
- The divisor also cannot be 0 or 1 (as the answer cannot be defined as an integer); if this occurs, throw
an ArithmeticException

#### Output
- See the unit tests for expected output; you can also verify this mathematically.

#### Hint
- Use a while loop and terminate as soon as the quotient is zero.

#### Notes
- This is a simple algorithm to approximate the logarithm of a number!
