### Loops2
Write a for loop that will create a string containing every nth number between start and end (exclusive).

There are multiple situations where your loop will not return any values. In these cases, the output should be an empty string. Specifically, the step cannot be negative or zero.

See the unit tests for example output. Note that the numbers are surround by round brackets
