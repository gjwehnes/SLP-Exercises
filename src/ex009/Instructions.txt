 1. Complete the Car.java class:

Include the following class variables:
make (type String)
model (type String)
numberOfDoors (type int)
topSpeed (type int)
price (type int)


Write four constructors:
* The main constructor
* A secondary constructor that does not include numberOfDoors, which should default to 4
* A secondary constructor that does not include make or model; both default to "unknown"
* A secondary constructor that does not include topSpeed or price; default to 90 and 0 respectively.
