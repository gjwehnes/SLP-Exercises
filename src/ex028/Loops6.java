/*
 * Write a method investmentCalculator that checks how many years it would take for an initial
 * investment to reach a target investment, given compound growth at an annual interest rate.
 * 
 * Note: The core of this calculation is simple, and can be written with a while loop.
 * However, there are two unusual cases which would give you an infinite loop, because the
 * initial investment would never reach the target investment. You will need to handle these
 * separately.
 * 
 * See the unit tests for example output.
