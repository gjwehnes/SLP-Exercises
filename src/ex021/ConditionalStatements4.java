 * Changing a verb in English to a corresponding adverb is fairly straight forward in English.
 * 
 * There are three rules to follow:
 * -In most cases, we do this by simply adding -ly to the end of the adjective
 * -When the adjective you want to make into an adverb ends in -y, you must change the y to an i, then add -ly.
 * -When the adjective ends in -le, remove the e and replace it with a y.
 * 
 * Create a method makeAdjective which does exactly this.
