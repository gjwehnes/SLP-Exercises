Rename file1.java to Person.java

Create the a Person class with the following:

Instance Variables
String firstName
String lastName
int birthMonth
int birthDay
int birthYear
All variables above should be private.

Constructor
The main constructor should take in all values and assign them to their respective private class variables

Methods
Create public getters and setters for all fields. e.g. 
getFirstName
getLastName
setFirstName
setLastName
etc.

Create a public getter method called getBirthday, which will return a String composed of their birthday in month/day/year format.  For example, if birthMonth=3, birthday=22, birthYear=2000, it should return the String "3/22/2000"

Validation
 It does not make sense for a Person's birthMonth to be set to a value less than 1 or greater than 12. Thus, add code to the setBirthMonth method so that if an invalid value is given, then the field is not modified. Similarly, for setBirthDay, if the value given is less than 1 or greater than 31, then do not modify the field. Note that this would still allow invalid dates to be set, but determining all valid dates is a tricky problem (think leap years)!

This is a good example of where encapsulation may be useful. If the birthMonth and birthDay fields were declared as private, there would be no way to stop another class from creating a Person with a birthday that makes no sense in reality. Thereby, you may catch an programming error (or a user typo) before it becomes a problem.
