We want to create a class 'Student' which can store three values: last name, first name, and ID

The class is already started and already has a constructor, which takes in the three initial values.

TODO:
1. Create three instance variables. These instance variables should all be set as private, which means that they are not visible (in scope) to any other class. In other words, these variables are encapsulated.

2. Provide public accessors for each of the instance variables in the Student class. In other words, you will need 3 "getters" that "expose" the underlying values. 

3. In the constructor, set the instance variables to the initial values that are passed in as parameters.
